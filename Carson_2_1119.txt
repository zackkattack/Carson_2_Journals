What is the process for locating the beginning of an image file? How? Why? 
First we have to find  our file headder in our image Then we search fro that headder to find the start of the file .
then convert it to dinary to echo " ibase=16: hex number" |bc to find the end. Then using echo "27766 - 21156" | bc
you find the bitadress for the whole file. finally using dd you can recreate the file.

First we search for ff8 We search for ffd8 by using the command xxd
Then we grep to find the line.
Using the value from that - we use echo and ibase to convert 00052A0 to a decimal number.
For example, in the example from yesterday, we found 00052A0 and converted it to decimal using the command ibase
Then to find the end of the file, we searched for ffd9 using the command grep.
******************************************************
Using that information, we find the number of bits, using the command echo "27766 - 21156" | bc
Then using dd we can reconstruct the file using the command dd if=image_carve.raw of=carv.jpg skip=21156 bs=1 count=6610
