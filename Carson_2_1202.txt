For your journal, consider (in writing), given that file headers change and hex editors change - what processes are you learning that 
lead to file recovery?

And may be extensible to other aspects of problem solving and life? [This does have an answer.] 

first you find the file headder of the file you want to recover.
Use that to find the the decimal number to bet the bit locatioin of the file.
then to find the ending, you would tail apreviously created file to find it .
then carve  the file

IN life things are not black and white. You will have to identify problems simmilar to yours and adjust to it.
