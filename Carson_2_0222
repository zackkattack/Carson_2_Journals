 Execute the command apt-cache search sniff
    1. What do you see?
        I see a search of GNU tools with sniff in the the title or the discriptions
    2. Copy and paste 3 names that sound intersting
        netsniff-ng - Linux network packet sniffer toolkit
        hexinject - Versatile packet injector and sniffer
        hunt - Advanced packet sniffer and connection intrusion
       Execute the command: cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
    3. What do you think it means?
        none of my ports are open
    4. Why might someone change the value to 1?
        open the port
       You should now install Zenmap
    5. What command(s) are needed to update and install zenmap?
        apt-get install zenmap
       Start zenmap
       root does not have permission to run graphics; you'll need to use xhost + from your normal VM user.
       In a terminal type: nmap --top-ports 25 10.4.27.YOURNINJA+1
    6. What do you see?
        ports that are open for me
    7. Change the 25 to 10 and then to 100 - what changed?
        Shortened the search list
       Enter the code: nmap -F 10.4.27.1-29
    8. What did you see?
        ports open on all computers on the networks
         Specifies that you wish to scan fewer ports than the default. Normally Nmap scans the most common 1,000 ports for each scanned protocol. With -F, this
           is reduced to 100.
    9. How might this be useful in a digital forensics investigation?
         to find what traffick is going where
   10. What is an OS?
        Operating systems
   11. Why would you scan the network for different OSes?
       -o is used for OS scans
        to identify devices
   12. What command did you use to scan d22 for different OSes?
        nmap -O 10.4.27.29
   13. What is the address of the printer?
        10.0.2.0/24
   14. What is the address of the switch?
        Try the code: nmap --iflist
        10.0.2.15/24
   15. What does it do?
   16. What are the ipv4 addresses?
        10.0.2.15/24
   17. What are the ipv6 addresses?
        fe80::a00:27ff:fe13:9388/64
   18. Why the difference?
       Now fire up Zenmap and take a picture of the network topography
   19. Why would you want a picture of network topography for digital forensics?
        to identify ips on the network
