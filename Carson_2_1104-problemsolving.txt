At Rackspace, the most important skills noted for achieving employment were problem-solving and active code development.
For example, presenters noted that they would be most likely to hire someone who goes home and spends hours working with 
Linux and networking.

Does that describe you? Why or why not?
  I would say that is me. I bought several computers and installed linux on them and also set up a home network in a week 
  by my self.
Similarly, presenters noted a demand for employees who were good at independent problem solving. Does that describe you? 
Why or why not?
  I like a good challange. I am not  easily detered from difficult situations eather. 

Have you finished your disk image? Why or why not?
