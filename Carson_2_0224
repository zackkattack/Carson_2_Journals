Using Zenmap, do a quick scan of the network

   Look at the 'hosts' and 'services' tab

   Click on services
   You should see approximately 7 services

   Click on each in order

        under Kerberos-sec I found 10.4.27.39. I found out that kerberos-sec is the computer 
        that allows nodes to talk to each other oover the network
